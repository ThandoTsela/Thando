The work I submitted was purely my own work. I haven't sought help outside of these exceptions:

  1. the textbook and other course materials
  2. clarifying questions answered or hints provided by Prof. Jiang (or on Piazza)
  3. discussions of the three design questions in Part II
  4. error messages searched on the Internet (without copying any code directly)
